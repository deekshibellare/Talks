//JSON parsing in Swift has been painful. Excellent swift developer community has developed few libraries to simplify the parsing chain. Even then, we had a lot of boilerplate parsing code. Take a look at this example of Parsing Twitter API to fetch username. How can we simplify?

import Foundation
let data = Data()
if let statusesArray = try? JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: data, options: .allowFragments) as? [[String: Any]],
    let user = statusesArray?[0]["user"] as? [String: Any],
    let username = user["name"] as? String {
    print(username)
}
//: [Next](@next)
